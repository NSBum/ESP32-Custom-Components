### Custom ESP32 components

A collection of components for the ESP-IDF build system targeting the ESP32 SoC. Some of these components, I've developed _de novo_, others I've modified based on the work of others, and some are straight-up someone else's work and presented here for no other reason than convenience.

#### Components

- TM1637 - This is a component to display numbers on a 4 digit LED display that uses the TM1637 controller chip.
- SI7021 - Read temperature and humidity from the SI7021 device.
